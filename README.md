## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup (Fresh Machine, Node 22 LTS)

If you're setting this up on a new machine, follow these steps to get the project running:

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- Node.js **LTS v22.x** installed ([https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org))
- npm (comes bundled with Node)

---

### ‚ö° Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ffxiv-tanuki/tanuki-biscuit.git
   cd tanuki-biscuit
   ```

2. Install project dependencies (includes dev tools):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. If you ever need to manually reinstall or fix development tools:

   ```bash
   npm install -D typescript tsx @types/node
   ```

4. Run the bot in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

### üß© Additional Notes

- We use `"type": "module"` for native ESM support.
- `.ts` files run directly using [`tsx`](https://github.com/esbuild-kit/tsx), no build step required during development.
- For production builds:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

- To deploy slash commands or utilities:

   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

### üì¶ Common Scripts

| Command            | Description                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `npm run dev`      | Run the bot using `tsx` (TypeScript, ESM)   |
| `npm run deploy`   | Run slash command deployment script         |
| `npm run build`    | Compile project to `dist/`                  |
| `npm start`        | Run the compiled JavaScript output          |

---

### ‚ùì Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors like `Unknown file extension ".ts"`:
- Make sure you're using Node **22.x LTS**.
- Ensure dependencies are installed with `npm install`.
- We rely on `tsx` for clean TypeScript execution in ESM mode.

If `tsx` or dev tools seem missing, run:

```bash
npm install -D typescript tsx @types/node
```
